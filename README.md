# Motif_finder
#This program has been developed as a tool for the Final Bachelor Thesis project of Diego Calzada Fraile, the author, in order to obtain the degree of "Grado en Bioquímica" (BSc in Biochemistry) from the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid.
#This tool is to be used in the checking for any variant of the consensus suequence of EXOmotifs, CLmotifs (Villarroya-Beltri et al. 2014) and hEXO motifs (Santangelo et al. 2016) within RNA sequences. 
#The input file has to be in FASTA format, i.e. it contains firstly a line that has to start with ">" in which the name of the sequence is uaually specified. In the following line the sequence is written either in capital letters or not. This program has not designed to analyze DNA sequences whose "T"s would be equivalent to "U"s in the motif.
